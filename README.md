# Mission Statement
Our team values the humanity and integrity of all peoples. We want to connect the organizations that are working for the greater good with volunteers that want to join in the cause to fight against homelessness. 

# Problem Statement
Homelessness is a serious issue all across America. In a recent study, it was found that over half a million people are considered homeless in the United States. There are over 11,000 people that are homeless in Seattle alone, 47.1% of which are suffering without shelter. We know that there are several organizations in our city that are working towards ending homelessness once and for all, but the issue will not disappear overnight. No matter how noble their mission may be, they still need help.

Homeless shelters can range from all sorts of mission statements. Whether they want to offer a space for the homeless to come and eat volunteer-cooked food or they provide clothing to prepare for harsher conditions, these organizations could always use help with donations. Organizations often receive charitable gifts, but there is a disconnect between the way that society can reach out to these groups. The information about what these organizations are gathering is located all over the place so it can be difficult for a person to find where they can donate these goods. The lack of donated items does not stem from the scarcity of resources, but rather in the inefficient information on where to donate said goods.
