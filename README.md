## Communication Guidelines
Group members are expected to check Slack often and respond to any inquires asked of them within 24 hours.

## @channel usage
Are acceptable when asking questions that pertain to the whole team. FYI posts to Slack should also be prefixed with @channel. No spam.

## Who is responsible for answering
Questions should be prefixed with an individual @ to specify who should answer. In the case that this isn't specified, anyone with an answer should come forward as soon as possible.
