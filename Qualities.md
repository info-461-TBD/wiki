# Qualities

## Security 
We need to verify that people are who they say they are, and we don’t want any fraudulent accounts or trolls to sign up. People will also have a lot of personal information on this website, so it’s extremely important that it doesn’t get leaked.

## Verifiability 
The nonprofits expect people to help out when people sign up, so it’s important that people are held accountable and can be verified. It’s also really important that the system works with the nonprofits and that people trust the product works as intended.

## Usefulness
The usefulness of our product is extremely important because we want to make sure that we truly are tackling homelessness and that we can offer genuine help to organizations. Since we are directly connecting volunteers to homeless shelters, it should successfully create a solution that can help organizations with their mission.

## User efficiency 
One of the big values in the product we’re building is the convenience. It’s important that potential volunteers can quickly create an account and sign up for events to encourage the greatest participation. 

## Reliability
We want to make sure that our data and connections are trustworthy. If there is no trust between us and the clients, then this website will not function to its full potential. As long as our website correctly connects volunteers to organizations, our website will be accomplishing its mission.

## Performance 
The efficiency at which the website can connect organizations and volunteers is very important to us. We want the experience from registering to be a volunteer to signing up for a volunteering opportunity to be as seamless as possible. The organizations and volunteers are already making a big step to help others, so we want it to be a simple and reliable process for them.

## Learnability 
Our target user group is a large, diverse group of people with varying degrees of familiarity with technology. Similarly, our application is simple and should be easy to learn for most users.

## Interoperability 
Using standard interfaces is important so that our users can learn how the app works faster. It is less important than learnability and user efficiency overall, but will definitely factor into the strength of those qualities. As our product is geared toward user interaction, it is still more important than the qualities below it. 
## Correctness 
We have a general outline for the features we want to see in the app, but we don’t have to stick super closely to the design specification, since we will no doubt add more stuff as we go along. However, it is still important that we follow a basic framework to build our app upon.

## Robustness 
As a web app, we only really need the app to work across all browsers, and make sure that it is functional in mobile environments. We’re not planning to make an app or anything at the moment. 

## Portability 
As this is primarily a web app, we think that just making responsive mobile design is enough to satisfy our portability threshold. 

## Accessibility 
Our app will pretty much only be built to be used on the web, and simply putting the basic accessibility guarantees like alt text and making the page text-to-speech readable will be sufficient for us, which is why accessibility is ranked so low. 

## Reusability 
We’re not really thinking about making the app usable for other purposes at this moment since we’re just focusing on the minimum viable product, so this isn’t that important to us. 

## Maintainability
Although maintainability is an important aspect of any living, breathing software project, we are undertaking this project in a classroom setting. As a result, we will not be working on it once the class concludes and thus, won’t need to worry about updating, fixing bugs, or adding features.
